Certainly! Here's the updated README.md file with instructions to use npm i for installing dependencies:

```markdown
# Project Setup

## Install Dependencies
Before starting, make sure to install project dependencies using:
```bash
npm i
```

## Start the Server
To launch the server, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Convert TypeScript to JavaScript
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript with:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Run Prettier for Code Formatting
Ensure code consistency using Prettier:
```bash
npm run format
```

## Environment Variables
Create an `.env` file at the root of your project to manage environment variables. Define necessary configurations such as:
```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Note: Keep the `.env` file secure and do not expose sensitive information.

```
